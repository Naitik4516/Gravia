## **üíª Installation & Setup**

We offer two methods for getting Gravia running, depending on whether you're a standard user or a developer.

### **1\. For Normal Users (Quick Start)**

This is the recommended method for users who want to quickly install and use Gravia with minimal setup.

#### **Prerequisites**

For full functionality, ensure these external dependencies are installed on your system:

* **FFmpeg:** Required for advanced file conversion and manipulation tasks.  
  * [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
* **Python:** Required for backend services.  
  * [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **uv:** A fast dependency manager for Python.  
  * [Download uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)

#### **Installation**

#### **1\. Backend Setup**

The backend is built with Python, utilizing the FastAPI framework.

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**  
   cd gravia/backend

2. Set Up Environment Variables:  
   Create a .env file in the backend directory and populate it with the necessary API keys for core services.

| Service | Environment Variable(s) | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Core LLM (Gemini) | GOOGLE\_API\_KEY or GEMINI\_API\_KEY | Key for core AI reasoning and intelligence. |
| ASR (Deepgram) | DEEPGRAM\_API\_KEY | Key for high-accuracy Automatic Speech Recognition. |
| Integrations (Composio) | COMPOSIO\_API\_KEY | Key for connecting to various third-party services (Gmail, Notion, etc.). |
| Observability (Langfuse) | LANGFUSE\_PUBLIC\_KEY, LANGFUSE\_SECRET\_KEY | Keys for tracking and analyzing LLM chain execution. |

3. Install Dependencies (using uv):  
   We recommend using uv for fast dependency management.  
   \# Install dependencies listed in pyproject.toml  
   uv pip install \-r pyproject.toml  
   \# OR, for locking and synchronization:  
   uv sync

4. **Run the FastAPI Server:**  
   \# Run the main application file (recommended if using uv run)  
   uv run main.py  
   \# OR, for development with hot-reloading:  
   fastapi dev main.py

#### **2\. Frontend Setup**

1. **Install via installer:**  
   Download and run the installer from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/Naitik4516/Gravia/releases/latest).
   This will set up the frontend application and create a desktop shortcut for easy access.
2. **Run the Frontend Application:**  
   Launch the Gravia application from your desktop shortcut or start menu.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Upcoming Features & Roadmap**

We're always working to expand Gravia's capabilities. Here‚Äôs what you can expect in the near future:

* **Wake Word Detection:** Activate Gravia with a simple voice command, without needing to press a button.  
* **GUI Automation:** Automate tasks within graphical user interfaces, making it possible to control any desktop application.  
* **Autonomous Agents:** We're developing a suite of specialized autonomous agents for tasks like:  
  * **Deep research**  
  * **Complex automation**  
  * **Reasoning**  
  * **Image generation & editing**
